# OpenAPI.NET library

OpenAPI.NET is a .NET library for working with OpenAPI documents. OpenAPI is a standard specification for describing HTTP APIs in a machine-readable and human-friendly way. With OpenAPI.NET, you can create, modify, validate, and convert (between JSON and YAML) OpenAPI documents in your .NET applications. The library includes readers and writers for serializing and deserializing OpenAPI documents to and from different formats and versions.

At a high level, OpenAPI.NET works by providing an object model for OpenAPI documents. This object model represents the different components of an OpenAPI document, such as its paths, operations, parameters, and responses.

## Benefits of using OpenAPI.NET

Some of the benefits of using the OpenAPI.NET library when working with OpenAPI documents include:

- **Ease of use:** OpenAPI.NET provides a useful object model for OpenAPI documents, making it easy to create and manipulate OpenAPI documents in your .NET code.

- **Flexibility:** OpenAPI.NET includes readers and writers for serializing and deserializing OpenAPI documents to and from different formats, including JSON and YAML. This functionality gives you the flexibility to work with OpenAPI documents in the format of your choice.

- **Reliability:** OpenAPI.NET can validate OpenAPI documents to ensure that they conform to the OpenAPI specification, helping you to catch and fix errors early in the development process.

- **Interoperability:** OpenAPI.NET can convert OpenAPI documents between different versions (versions 2.0 and 3.0 and soon 3.1) of the OpenAPI specification, as well as between different formats (JSON and YAML), making it easy to share and collaborate on OpenAPI documents with others.

- **Customization:** OpenAPI.NET supports changing the validation rules and creating custom serializers/deserializer for extensions.
