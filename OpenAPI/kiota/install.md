## Run in Docker

You can run Kiota in our Docker container with one of the following commands.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD051 -->
### [bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
docker run -v /some/output/path:/app/output \
-v /some/input/description.yml:/app/openapi.yml \
mcr.microsoft.com/openapi/kiota generate --language csharp -n namespace-prefix
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
docker run -v /some/output/path:/app/output `
-v /some/input/description.yml:/app/openapi.yml `
mcr.microsoft.com/openapi/kiota generate --language csharp -n namespace-prefix
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD051 -->

> [!TIP]
> You can alternatively use the `--openapi` parameter with a URI instead of volume mapping.

To generate a client library from an online OpenAPI description and into the current directory:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 MD051 -->
### [bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app/output mcr.microsoft.com/openapi/kiota \
generate --language typescript -n gfx -d \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell/dev/openApiDocs/v1.0/Mail.yml
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app/output mcr.microsoft.com/openapi/kiota `
generate --language typescript -n gfx -d `
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell/dev/openApiDocs/v1.0/Mail.yml
```

## Install as .NET tool

If you have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed, you can install Kiota as a [.NET tool](/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools).

To install the tool, execute the following command.

```bash
dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.OpenApi.Kiota
```

## Build from source

1. Clone the [Kiota repository](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota).
1. Install the [.NET SDK 8.0](https://get.dot.net/8).
1. Open the solution with Visual Studio and right select *publish* **or** execute the following command:

    ```bash
    dotnet publish ./src/kiota/kiota.csproj -c Release -p:PublishSingleFile=true -r <runtime-identifiers>
    ```

    | Runtime identifier | Value     |
    |--------------------|-----------|
    | Linux (x64)        | linux-x64 |
    | macOS (arm64)      | osx-arm64 |
    | macOS (x64)        | osx-x64   |
    | Windows (x64)      | win-x64   |
    | Windows (x86)      | win-x86   |

    > [!NOTE]
    > Refer to [.NET runtime identifier catalog](/dotnet/core/rid-catalog) so select the appropriate runtime for your platform.

    For example, the following command builds for Windows (x64).

     ```bash
    dotnet publish ./src/kiota/kiota.csproj -c Release -p:PublishSingleFile=true -r win-x64
    ```

1. Navigate to the output directory (usually under `src/kiota/bin/Release/net7.0`).
1. Run `kiota.exe ...`.

## Install the Visual Studio Code extension

1. Open the [Marketplace page of the extension](https://aka.ms/kiota/extension)
1. Select on the **Install** button.

> [!NOTE]
> The Kiota Visual Studio Code extension is currently in public preview and is subject to change.

## Run in GitHub actions

You can use the [setup Kiota GitHub Action](https://github.com/microsoft/setup-kiota/) in your workflow to automate client refresh and more by adding a reference to it in your workflow definition and using the CLI just like you would locally.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - uses: microsoft/setup-kiota@v0.5.0

  - name: Update kiota clients in the repository
    run: kiota update -o . # for a complete documentation of the CLI commands see https://aka.ms/kiota/docs
    working-directory: src # assumes client is under the src path in your repository
```

> [!NOTE]
> The setup Kiota GitHub Action in public preview and is subject to change.

[REST API Client Code Generator](https://github.com/christianhelle/apiclientcodegen) is a collection of Visual Studio C# custom tool code generators for OpenAPI specifications. This extension installs Kiota on-demand and adds the required NuGet packages to build the generated code to the project. The generated code is created as a "code-behind" file to the OpenAPI specifications file in the .NET project. This extension offers same-day releases for new Kiota versions, but this requires updating the extension, which can be configured to be automatically.

### Installation

1. From Visual Studio (Windows), using the [Manage Extensions](/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions) dialog box (**Tools** -> **Manage Extensions**), search for extension  called **REST API Client Code Generator**. This extension is available for [Visual Studio 2022 for AMD64 and ARM64](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChristianResmaHelle.ApiClientCodeGenerator2022) and [Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChristianResmaHelle.ApiClientCodeGenerator)

    > [!NOTE]
    > For Visual Studio for Mac, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/christianhelle/apiclientcodegen/blob/master/docs/VisualStudioForMac.md#installation)

1. Select on the **Download** button. To complete the installation, restart Visual Studio.

1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/christianhelle/apiclientcodegen/blob/master/docs/KiotaUsage.md) for generating code.
